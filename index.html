				<h2>Handball 🤾🏼‍♀️</h2>
				<p>I have been playing handball for 4 years now. Before I moved to Lille, I was in my town's club and I had a very special bond with the other girls of my team. But I haven't stopped playing this sport, I have joined the team of IESEG to continue playing. I really love the collective part of this sport, it makes you feel and experience incredible emotions.</p>

				<h2>Musique 🎶</h2>
				<p>Since I was little, I have been really attracted to music. I used to play the flute and a little bit of piano. I also really like to sing, I enjoy doing some karaokes at home when I'm on my own, but I also have already been performing in front of other persons. I listen to music on a daily basis, when I walkt to school, when I am having a shower, even a bit when I'm studying. Music really is a big part of my life.</p>

				<h2>Series and Animes 📺</h2>
				<p>I enjoy spending time watching series and animes. I didn't really watch those two before, I was actually more enjoying movies and books but my mind has changed over the time. Since I have been in Lille, I'm in my own appartment, alone, so I don't really watch TV, when I'm eating or in the evening, I really enjoy watching some episodes. I should just be careful I don't lose myself and watch too many instead of sleeping or working.</p>

				<h2>Find more about my personality 🧜🏼‍♀️</h2>
				<p><strong>If I were a song, I would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DfQC5qHhbo">Neon</a> by John Mayer</strong>. <br>She comes and goes and no one knows, she’s slipping through my hands…</br><br><strong>If I were a color, I would be yellow</strong>. <br>Yellow represents freshness, dynamism and gentleness, but it is also a discreet color, especially when it is associated with white.</br></br><strong>If I were an animal, I would be a meerkat</strong>. <br>The meerkat is curious and open to new impressions. It represents the sense of responsibility, loyalty and solidarity.</br><br><strong>If I were a Netflix character, I would be Lara Jean Covey from <i>To all the boys I’ve met before.</i></strong><br>Lara Jean is considered like a nice girl, a little eccentric and shy who likes scrapbooking, fashion, mainly Korean and vintage clothes and bakery.</br></br><strong>If I were a Disney princess, I would be Anna of Arendelle from <i>Frozen</i></strong>. <br>Anna is an upbeat, energetic, clumsy and usually far from elegant young woman. She is also free-minded and has acquired an outgoing mentality, she makes friends easily and seek affection and camaraderie.</br><br><strong>If I were a season, I would be spring</strong>.</br>Spring represents gentleness and liveliness; it is the awakening of Mother Nature after a long winter.</p>
